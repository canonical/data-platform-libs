"""Relation requirer side abstraction for database relation.

This library is a uniform interface to a selection of common database
metadata, with added custom events that add convenience to database management,
and methods to consume the application related data.

Following an example of using the DatabaseCreatedEvent, in the context of the
application charm code:

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.database_requires import DatabaseRequires

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):
    # Application charm that connects to database charms.

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Charm events defined in the database requires charm library.
        self.database = DatabaseRequires(self, relation_name="database", database_name="database")
        self.framework.observe(self.database.on.database_created, self._on_database_created)

    def _on_database_created(self, _) -> None:
        # Handle the created database

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            self.database.username,
            self.database.password,
            self.database.endpoints,
        )

        # Start application with rendered configuration
        self._start_application(config_file)

        # Set active status
        self.unit.status = ActiveStatus("received database credentials")
```
